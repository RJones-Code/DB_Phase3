(1) Add the files in the PHP folder to a folder name Phase2Database in htdocs.
(2)Change the ip address in string.xml to your ip address.
(3)Build the Gradle. This should automatically create a config with a module.
(4) Create a virtual device via the device manager. The pixel 4 works well.
(5)Running the program will start the device and bring you to the welcome page.
